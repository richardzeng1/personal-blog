I've gone through a lot of trial and error to get to where I currently am as a software engineer. Along the way, I've made many common mistakes that
could have been avoided if someone informed me. Although I had mentors at the companies where I worked, I had minimal guidance in school, career progression
and work life balance. I don't expect to be your mentor but just to be someone you can read about to see the possible outcomes of a decision before taking
a leap of faith.
