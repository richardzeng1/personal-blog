Have you ever heard

"Its good to learn from your mistakes but its better to learn from the mistakes of others"


Well be prepared to learn from an idiot. I'll make all the mistakes so you don't have to. If you read this and still make the mistakes, I guess you are the bigger idiot and should be running my blog. I'll try to cover things that most people want to try but just haven't had the opportunity to do it.

I'll love to take suggestions about topics you want covered but just know that in order for me to have a well formed opinion, I have to try things out for multiple months.
